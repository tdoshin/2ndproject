## Challenges
A major challenge I experienced with this build was knowing how to manipulate the objects in my schema to perform the various functions I needed. Thanks to additional resources, I overcame this obstacle. 

## Existing Bugs
None but currently trying to create a home page that will be able to access all the user sessions/data and render on the homepage with an added functionality for each user to like other users dishes 

## Next Steps 
Create more functionalities for users to be able to comment on each others' dishes
